      <p>At its core, MEGRYCO, Inc. seeks to build, manage and ultimately grow communities in Plymouth and on the South Shore. Our full-circle services allow us to assist our clients more thoroughly with our informed, consistent collaboration and communication regarding everything building and leasing. And, we are uniquely positioned to not only develop a property or community, but do so with an eye on the future maintenance and lifelong comfort of our clients.

        While offering a personal, well-informed experience, our small team works seamlessly together across our three main services—design, development and management— connecting our clients to the exact decision makers they need to move their project or leasing process along. And, we certainly don’t sacrifice resources in the name of small company size. Our clients have access to the bandwidth and near endless resources of a much larger organization, without sacrificing a personal connection.


        Based in Plymouth, Massachusetts for over three decades, MEGRYCO, Inc. is a proud, family-owned company with an impressive portfolio of diverse properties and a host of satisfied clients, tenants and city partners.
